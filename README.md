# ☃ Snowman Meltdown

A simple console-based word-guessing game in Python, similar to Hangman — but here your snowman melts with every incorrect guess.  
Try to guess the hidden word before the snowman disappears completely!

---

## 🧊 Overview

- The game randomly selects a secret word.
- You guess letters one by one.
- Each wrong guess melts part of the snowman (ASCII art).
- After **4 mistakes**, the snowman is completely melted and you lose.
- If you reveal all letters in time, you win!
